In this study, we investigated variations \\nin the enteric neural plexus abnormalities in MWS using morphometry-based \\nhistopathologic analysis.\\nMETHODS: Seven patients with MWS (3 with mutations in exon 8 of ZFHX1B and 4 \\nwith deletions) who had undergone modified Duhamel's operations for Hirschsprung \\ndisease were examined. Surgically resected rectosigmoid specimens were analyzed \\nmorphometrically.\\nRESULTS: The length of the aganglionic segment was longer than 3 cm in all the \\npatients with deletions. In 3 patients with mutations, the aganglionic region \\nwas not detected in the surgically resected specimens; however, the parameters \\nof the ganglions and plexus were significantly smaller than those of controls \\n(cloaca and aproctia), indicative of a transitional zone. Variation in the \\nseverity of pathological changes among the 3 patients with mutations was also \\nnoted.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The variations in myenteric plexus pathologies in MWS appear to be \\ncaused by both variations in ZFHX1B abnormalities and epigenetic factors.\"],\n",

These molecules are \\nphotosensitizing and we propose to assess efficacy of red light that activates \\nporphyrins (photodynamic reaction) in treatment of this pathology.\\nOBJECTIVES: Assessment of effects of photodynamic action of red light for \\ntreatment of erythrasma without exogenous photosensitizing molecules.\\nMETHODS: Thirteen patients with erythrasma were treated by one illumination (80 \\nJ/cm2) by red light (broad band, peak at 635 nm) without exogenous \\nphotosensitizing molecules. Disappearance or reduction of extent of lesions were \\nobserved 2 weeks later. If lesions were still present, a second irradiation was \\nconducted with the same method.\\nRESULTS: Preliminary results are presented. As a result of red light \\nirradiation, we noticed a complete recovery for three patients and, in most \\nother cases, reduction of extent of lesions (mean: -29% after one session). The \\ntreatment was well tolerated.\\nCONCLUSION: We report first cases of photodynamic treatment of erythrasma. There \\nare other reports of clinical applications of antimicrobial action of \\nphotodynamic therapy in dermatology (acne vulgaris, leishmaniasis, warts, etc.). \\nBut there are few applications without addition of exogenous photosensitizing \\nagent. The originality and interest of our study is to use spontaneous presence \\nof porphyrins in the lesions. This technique seems to be an interesting \\nalternative, inexpensive and easy, for the treatment of this localized \\ninfection. But an optimal method is still to be determined to improve efficacy.

The suppressors function through heterodimerization \\nwith the death promoters, Bax and related proteins, thus establishing a set \\npoint within the cell that determines whether or not apoptosis is executed in \\nresponse to a death signal. Sequence similarities between 19K and Bcl-2 are \\nlargely restricted to short Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains that mediate interaction \\nwith Bax. The BH1 sequence in 19K is degenerate but nevertheless contains a \\nconserved glycine residue found in all family members that when mutated to \\nalanine in Bcl-2 results in loss of Bcl-2 function and ability to dimerize with \\nBax (Yin, X.-M., Oltvai, Z. N., and Korsmeyer, S. J. (1994) Nature 369, \\n321-323). Here, we show that the analogous mutation in BH1 of 19K also abrogates \\nthe anti-apoptotic properties of 19K and its ability to interact with Bax, thus \\nestablishing the critical importance of this residue within BH1 and the likely \\nsimilarity of Bcl-2 and 19K function. In distinct contrast to Bcl-2, however, \\n19K interaction was not detected with Bad, a Bcl-2/Bcl-XL dimerizing protein \\nthat can potentially regulate a Bax middle dotBcl-2/Bcl-XL survival set point \\nand reinstate susceptibility to a death signal. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic \\nfunction of 19K was not overcome by enforced expression of Bad in transfected \\ncells. This feature of 19K may provide adenovirus with a selective advantage in \\nevading premature induction of apoptosis by the host cell.\\n\\n### Answer ###\\n'}], 'temperature': 0.0, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

The \\nmechanistic explanation for this colinearity has been elusive, and it may well \\nbe that a single and universal cause does not exist. The Hox-gene complex \\n(HOM-C) has been rearranged differently in several Drosophila species, producing \\na striking diversity of Hox gene organizations. We investigated the genomic and \\nfunctional consequences of the two HOM-C splits present in Drosophila buzzatii. \\nFirstly, we sequenced two regions of the D. buzzatii genome, one containing the \\ngenes labial and abdominal A, and another one including proboscipedia, and \\ncompared their organization with that of D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura in \\norder to map precisely the two splits. Then, a plethora of conserved noncoding \\nsequences, which are putative enhancers, were identified around the three Hox \\ngenes closer to the splits. The position and order of these enhancers are \\nconserved, with minor exceptions, between the three Drosophila species. Finally, \\nwe analyzed the expression patterns of the same three genes in embryos and \\nimaginal discs of four Drosophila species with different Hox-gene organizations. \\nThe results show that their expression patterns are conserved despite the HOM-C \\nsplits. We conclude that, in Drosophila, Hox-gene clustering is not an absolute \\nrequirement for proper function. Rather, the organization of Hox genes is \\nmodular, and their clustering seems the result of phylogenetic inertia more than \\nfunctional necessity.\\n\\n### Answer ###\\n'}], 'temperature': 0.0, 'extra_body': {}}'\n",

Interestingly, the newly discovered FANCB gene is \\nX-linked and subject to X-inactivation.

Your task is to provide accurate, concise answers to medical questions based on summaries of relevant biomedical literature. You MUST ensure responses are clear, informative, unbiased, and avoid stereotypes. Answer in a natural, human-like manner. You will be penalized for answers that are unclear, inaccurate, biased, or overly verbose.\\n\\n### Process ###\\n1. Carefully analyze the provided question to understand the key information needed. \\n2. Review the summary of relevant excerpts from biomedical literature.\\n3. Identify the most pertinent information in the summary for answering the question.\\n4. Synthesize the key points into a coherent, concise answer.\\n5. If the summary lacks sufficient information to conclusively answer the question, state \"There is insufficient information provided to conclusively answer the question.\"\\n\\n### Format ###\\nQuestion: <question>\\nAnswer: <final_answer_based_on_summary>\\n\\n### Example ###\\nQuestion: Is Hirschsprung disease a mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?\\n\\nSummary: Hirschsprung disease, particularly in the context of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) associated with ZFHX1B mutations or deletions, shows variations in enteric neural plexus abnormalities. The pathologies in MWS are attributed to variations in ZFHX1B abnormalities and epigenetic factors.\\n\\nRelevant Excerpts: \\n- Patients with ZFHX1B mutations or deletions develop multiple congenital anomalies including Hirschsprung disease, known as Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS). (Score: 0.6024968654169915)\\n\\nAnswer: Based on the summary, Hirschsprung disease in Mowat-Wilson syndrome appears to have both genetic and multifactorial components. Variations in ZFHX1B abnormalities suggest a genetic basis, while the role of epigenetic factors points to a multifactorial etiology. However, the provided information is limited in conclusively determining if Hirschsprung disease more broadly is purely Mendelian or multifactorial.\\n\\n### Evaluation ###\\nYour performance will be evaluated on:\\n- Accuracy and relevance of the answer based on the provided summary\\n- Clarity and conciseness of the response \\n- Ability to identify when the summary is insufficient to conclusively answer the question\\n- Avoidance of bias and stereotyping\\n- Adherence to the specified format\\n\\nYou MUST provide an answer that directly addresses the question using only the information in the summary. If the summary is insufficient, state that conclusively answering is not possible.

While a previous study suggested BRCA2 could be identical to FANCD1 and FANCB, a new study identified FANCB as a distinct component (FAAP95) of the FA core complex, indicating that BRCA2 does not act upstream of the FA pathway. The newly discovered FANCB gene is X-linked and crucial for genomic integrity.
